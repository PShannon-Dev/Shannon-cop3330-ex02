/*Exercise 2 - Counting the Number of Characters
Create a program that prompts for an input string and displays output that shows the input string and the number of
characters the string contains.

Example Output
What is the input string? Homer
Homer has 5 characters.

Constraints
Be sure the output contains the original string.
Use a single output statement to construct the output.
Use a built-in function of the programming language to determine the length of the string.

Challenges
If the user enters nothing, state that the user must enter something into the program.
Implement this program using a graphical user interface and update the character counter every time a key is pressed.
    If your language doesnâ€™t have a particularly friendly GUI library, try doing this exercise with HTML and JavaScript instead.

        //create scanner for input, make sure to input java.util package
        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
        String origString = input.nextLine();

        //print out resulting length in one output statement using the built-in function - string.length()
        System.out.printf("%s has %d characters.\n", origString, origString.length());
